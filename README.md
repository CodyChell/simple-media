# simiple-media

## Overview
For this assignment, you will make a web page that uses different types of media files.  

*Important*: As you build this page, be careful in the use of content that belongs to others. Unless you have created the content yourself, I expect that you will only use content from others with permission and include appropriate acknowledgements for the content creators.


## GitHub
The GitHub repository for this assignment is [simple-media](https://github.com/htc-ccis1301/simple-media).

The repository contains the standard Readme.md and .gitignore files and an empty index.html file.


## Requirements
Create a web page that demonstrates your ability to include multimedia files on your website. The web page should include:

- basic CSS for styling, ensure good presentation with adequate spacing
- a short audio or video or clip (preferably one you make yourself) with a link to download
- an iframe with a youtube video
- an image styled to look like a Polaroid picture (see page 364) & rotated slightly
- a link that has a transition applied to change the __font size__ when you hover over it
- an image gallery similar to the one from the hands on practice, but only includes 3 images stacked vertically instead of the 6 show
- Bonus:  Flip the gallery display so that the large image is on the left and the 3 stacked images are on the right
- Use [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) to add icons for social media to the footer of your page
- Find a non-standard font and include and use it on your page using CSS @font-face
